# Personal Development Enviroment (PDE)

## Introduction

When I first started programming, I believed the path to become a better developer was simple, just understand my code more.
But over time, I realized I was wrong. Writing better code isn’t just about syntax or algorithms, it’s about mastering the
environment in which you grow as a programmer.

The true key is understanding your Personal Development Environment (PDE). Just as an IDE shapes how we code, our PDE shapes
how we learn, build, and improve. When you design your PDE with intention, you don’t just become a better programmer; you
become stronger in every part of the programming ecosystem.

## What is PDE?

You may not have heard the term PDE before, but you’re already familiar with its closest cousin: the IDE
(Integrated Development Environment). Every developer knows that an IDE provides the tools, plugins, and shortcuts that make
writing code faster, cleaner, and more enjoyable.

But here’s the problem: most IDEs are built by big corporations like Microsoft with VS Code, JetBrains with PyCharm, and so on.
That means they come with someone else’s vision of the “perfect development environment.”
And while that works for many, it doesn’t always work for you.

Why? Because developers are not all the same. We think differently, we work differently, we learn differently. When you’re
forced to adapt to an environment that doesn’t fit your style, you risk friction, frustration, confusion, and sometimes
even burnout.

That’s where PDE (Personal Development Environment) comes in. Instead of accepting a one-size-fits-all setup, you design your
own environment: the tools, the workflows, the habits, and even the mindset that make you more effective. Just like
configuring Neovim to fit your workflow, PDE is about building a development ecosystem that is uniquely yours.
crafted for growth, efficiency, and sustainability.

## How to make your own PDE?

Alright, now that you know what a PDE is, let’s get into the fun part: how to actually build one for yourself.

First things first we need to identify the main tools of any development environment. In my experience,
there are three tools you must use:

- The Text Editor – The place that to type code in.

- The Terminal – your command center, the gate to your OS.

- The Version Control System – your tracker, that you use to see the braches and versions of your project.

Now let’s break them down.

1. The Text Editor

This is where you live as a programmer. It’s not just a tool, it’s an extension of your brain.

It needs to be fast, customizable, and scalable because your workflow today will not be the same six months from now.

My humble opinion? Neovim. Why? Because it’s not just a text editor, it’s the superior text editor. Highly customizable,
lightweight, and "Programmer friendly". You’ll see in the practical part of this workshop how it can change it into anything
you want it to be.

2. The Terminal

The terminal is your control room "The to your OS". Every real programmer knows: this is where the magic happens.

It lets you talk directly to your machine, execute projects, run scripts, and feel like a true hacker.

My setup? On Windows, I go with CMD and my own XShell (yes, I literally built my own shell in C because why not?). On Linux,
I use Zsh, because it’s super customizable, and it just feels smooth.

Fun fact: my shell, XShell, even has its own built in text editor called XCODEX. So yeah.. I kind of live inside my own PDE.

3. Version Control System

Now let’s talk about the time machine of programming: version control.

Without it, you’re basically coding in quicksand one mistake and poof, everything is gone.

With it, you can jump across branches, roll back to stable versions, and work with others.

My tool of choice? Git. The standard. The legend. The gift of Linus Torvalds himself (shoutout to the man who not only made
Linux but also gave us Git).

Master these, customize them, and connect them and you’ve got the foundation of a PDE that isn’t just functional, but uniquely
yours.

### What is Neovim and Vim Motions?

#### Neovim is basically Vim leveled up.

Vim itself is a legendary text editor, famous for being fast, lightweight, and completely controlled by the keyboard. It’s been
around since the early ’90s, and developers either fear it or absolutely love it. (You know the meme: “How do I exit Vim?”)

Neovim takes everything that made Vim great, the speed, the crazy powerful motions, the “my hands never leave the keyboard”
magic, and makes it modern. It’s not a total rewrite, it’s a continuation. Think of it like a new modern Vim with Lua scripting
support, plugins, and working on any setup you throw at it.

The key idea? Extensibility and usability.

- If you want bare-bones, it can be minimal.

- If you want a full IDE, you can build it with plugins.

#### Vim motions are the secret sauce of Vim (and Neovim)

They’re keyboard commands that let you move through and edit text at lightning speed, no mouse, no arrow keys,
just pure flow.

They’re part of Vim’s modal editing superpower: instead of typing and editing in the same way, you switch modes. Motions
combine with actions (like delete, change, yank) to let you surgically manipulate text.

Example:

- daw → delete a word.

- ci" → change everything inside quotes.

- gg=G → auto-format the whole file.

Think of motions like coding spells: short incantations that instantly reshape your code exactly how you want. Once you get
them, you’ll wonder how you ever lived without them. that's a real fact btw....

### Who is DHH?

DHH, short for David Heinemeier Hansson, is one of those rare people who left a massive fingerprint on modern programming.

- Creator of Ruby on Rails, the web framework that powered giants like GitHub, Shopify, Airbnb, and more.

- Co-founder & CTO of 37signals.

- Creator of Omniarchy, a Linux based OS experiment focused on webapps.

- Best selling author (Rework, It Doesn’t Have to Be Crazy at Work).

- Le Mans class winning race car driver (yes, he codes and races).

- Board member at Shopify.

In short: he reshaped the way we build web applications and proved that you can be a world class programmer, entrepreneur,
writer, and even racer, all in one lifetime. What a great man...

## Let's Create our own PDEs...

## The End

So here’s the big takeaway: your tools shape your craft.
It’s not just about writing code, it’s about how you write it, how you interact with it, and how your environment supports
or handle your growth.

IDEs are fine, but they’re someone else’s vision.

A PDE is your vision. It’s your editor, your terminal, your version control, your workflow, your rules.

By building a PDE, you’re not just customizing software, you’re customizing your mind’s interface with code.

And here’s the secret: a PDE isn’t something you set up once and forget. It evolves with you. As you grow as a programmer,
your environment grows with you.

So don’t settle for default. Experiment. Break things. Rebuild. Craft an environment that feels like home.
Because when you sit down to code in your PDE, it shouldn’t just feel like writing software, it should feel like becoming
the best version of yourself as a programmer.

This is the philosophy of the PDE. This is the power of owning your craft.
