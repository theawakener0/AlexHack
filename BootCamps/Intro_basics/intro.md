# Intro into Programming with C++

## Introduction

Hi, in this bootcamp, we will learn something different than you think, something new and interesting. We will learn not only how to code but also how to think like a programmer. We will the foudational aspects of programming and problem solving. We will learn how to break down a problem into smaller parts and how to solve each part step by step. We will also learn how to write clean and efficient code that is easy to read and understand.

The key is not to memorize the syntax of a programming language but to understand the logic behind it. Once you understand the logic, you can easily learn any programming language.

And The best thing is that we will use C++ as our programming language. C++ is a powerful language that is widely used in various fields such as game development, system programming, and embedded systems. It is also a great language for beginners because it teaches you the fundamentals of programming and helps you develop a good problem solving skills.

And also we choose it because it is one of the best languages to learn programming concepts that can be applied to other languages as well. (We love it)...

So, Let's get started! to the world of programming.

But before we start coding, let's first understand what programming is and what a programming language is.

### What is Programming?

Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a specific task. It is a way of communicating with the computer to make it do what we want it to do. Programming involves writing code in a programming language, which is a set of rules and syntax that the computer can understand.

### What is a Programming Language?

A programming language is a formal language that consists of a set of instructions that can be used to create software programs. It is a way of expressing algorithms and data structures in a way that a computer can understand and execute. There are many programming languages available, each with its own syntax and rules. Some popular programming languages include C++, Python, Java, and JavaScript.

### How to Write Code?

Writing code involves using a programming language to create a set of instructions that the computer can understand and execute. Here are the basic steps to write code:
1. Choose a programming language: Select a programming language that is suitable for the task you want to accomplish.
2. Set up a development environment: Install the necessary software and tools to write and run code in your chosen programming language.
3. Write the code: Use a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) to write the code using the syntax and rules of the chosen programming language.
4. Test the code: Run the code to see if it works as expected and fix aerrors or bugs that may arise.
5. Debug the code: Use debugging tools to identify and fix any errors or issues in the code.
6. Refactor the code: Improve the code by making it more efficient, readable, and maintainable.
7. Document the code: Add comments and documentation to explain the purpose and functionality of the code.
8. Share the code: Share the code with others by publishing it on a code repository or sharing it with colleagues.
9. Maintain the code: Update and maintain the code as needed to ensure it continues to work as expected and meets the requirements of the task.

### The Philosophy of programming

"Code is not just instructions for machines, it's the crystallization of human thought. Every function, every variable name, every architectural decision reflects the mind of its creator and a path for the human evolution."
