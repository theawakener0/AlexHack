# Intro into Programming with C++

## Introduction

Hi, in this bootcamp, we will learn something different than you think, something new and interesting. We will learn not only how to code but also how to think like a programmer. We will the foudational aspects of programming and problem solving. We will learn how to break down a problem into smaller parts and how to solve each part step by step. We will also learn how to write clean and efficient code that is easy to read and understand.

The key is not to memorize the syntax of a programming language but to understand the logic behind it. Once you understand the logic, you can easily learn any programming language.

And The best thing is that we will use C++ as our programming language. C++ is a powerful language that is widely used in various fields such as game development, system programming, and embedded systems. It is also a great language for beginners because it teaches you the fundamentals of programming and helps you develop a good problem solving skills.

And also we choose it because it is one of the best languages to learn programming concepts that can be applied to other languages as well. (We love it)...

So, Let's get started! to the world of programming.

But before we start coding, let's first understand what programming is and what a programming language is.

## What is Programming?
Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a specific task. It is a way of communicating with the computer to make it do what we want it to do. Programming involves writing code in a programming language, which is a set of rules and syntax that the computer can understand.

## What is a Programming Language?
A programming language is a formal language that consists of a set of instructions that can be used to create software programs. It is a way of expressing algorithms and data structures in a way that a computer can understand and execute. There are many programming languages available, each with its own syntax and rules. Some popular programming languages include C++, Python, Java, and JavaScript.
